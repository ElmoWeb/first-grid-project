First CSS Grid Project

Continuing the web development bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu, I was given a grid coding challange. The challange was to choose a picture from "Mondrian Compositions" and creating it using CSS grid. In addition, we were asked to make sure to center the page. 

You may see the picture I choose as the "Mondrian_Compositions" file.
